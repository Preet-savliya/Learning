Entity - an entity is a real world object that can be uniquely identified and about which data is stored in a database.

Types of Entity
1. Strong Entity : Exists independently | Example: Student, Employee
2. Weak Entity : Depends on another Entity | Example: Marks (Depends on Student)

Example : In a School Database, Student is the Entity, Teacher is the Entity.

an entity has an attributes (details)








Attributes - Attributes are the details or properties of an entity. they describe more information about the entity.

Example: Student(Entity)
attributes :- Roll No, Name, Age, Class, Marks.

Types of Attributes
1. Simple Attributes - Cannot be divided further | Example : age, gender
2. Composite Attributes - can be divided further | Example : name as First name + Last name, Address as Street, City, PIN.
3. Single-Valued Attributes - Has only one value | Example : Date of Birth
4. Multi-Valued Attributes - Can have many values | Example : Phone no, Email ID's
5. Key Attributes - uniquely identifies an entity | Example : Roll no, Account no

Entity = Person
Attributes = Height, Name, Age, Hair Color









Entity-Relationship Diagram (ER) - ER Diagram is a Diagram that shows entities, attributes & Relationship connection between entities. it is used to design a database before creating it.

simple ER Diagram example 

Student course system 

Student -> Roll no (Key)
        -> Name
        -> Age

Course -> Course ID (Key)
       -> Course name

Relationship -> Student Enrolls in Course

There are 3 types of Entities
1. 1:1 - One to One --> Person to Passport
2. 1:M - One to Many  --> Teachers to Students
3. M:M - Many to Many  --> Students to Courses

Why ER Diagrams are important ?

---- Easy to understand data
---- helps in database planning
---- Reduces mistake
---- used before writing SQL code
