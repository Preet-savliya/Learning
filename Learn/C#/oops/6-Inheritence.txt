Inheritance - Inheritance means one class (child) uses the properties and methods of another class (parent). it helps reuse code and makes programs easier to manage. this is used with " : " this symbol.

Parent class - gives features
Child class - takes features

class Animal   // Parent class
{
    public void Eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal is eating");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal   // Child class
{
    public void Bark()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog is barking");
    }
}

usage:

Dog d = new Dog();
d.Eat();   // from Animal
d.Bark();  // from Dog

Types of Inheritance in C#
---- Single Inheritance
---- Multilevel Inheritance
---- Hierarchical Inheritance

Multilevel Inheritance :- 

class Vehicle     // Parent class
{
    public void Start() 
    {
    }
}

class Car : Vehicle   // Child class
{
}

class ElectricCar : Car   // Child class
{
}

Inheritance =  getting features from another class using :
