Basic Concept in Object Oriented Programming in C#

Class - class is a template it tells what data an object will have & what actions an object can do.

For creating a class use keyword class.

class car
{
    public string color; // field
    public int speed; // field

    public void Drive() // method
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The car is driving");
    }
}

Color and speed are data.
Drive() is and actions.
car is and class.

Object is an instance of class or object is a real thing made from a class it uses the class. what data an object will have & what actions an object can do. objects can work and store the values. we can also create multiple objects in one class.

car mycar = new car(); 
mycar.color = "Red";
mycar.speed = "200";
mycar.Drive();

mycar is an object. it has its own color and speed. it can call Drive()

one for example Student Form is a class and student name rahul, address is an object.

Member - members are the parts inside a class that defines what an object has and can do.

types of members in c# - fields(variables), methods(functions), properties, constructors

1. Fields (variables) - they store data.

class Student 
{
    public string name;
    public int age;
}

name and age are members of the class.

2. Methods - they perform actions or do a specific task.

class Student
{
    public void Study()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The Student is Studying.");
    }
}

Study() is a member of a class.

3. properties - they are used to get or set values safely. or properties are members of a class that provide a flexible and controlled way to read, write, or compute the value of private fields

class Student
{
    public in Age{ get; set; }
}

Age is a member of a class.

4. constructors - they run automatically when an object is created.

class Student
{
    public string name;
    public int age;

    // Constructor
    public Student()
    {
        name = "Unknown";
        age = 0;
    }
}

Student s1 = new Student();  // constructor is called
Console.WriteLine(s1.name);

Parameterized Constructor - Used to pass values while creating an object.

class Student
{
    public string name;
    public int age;

    public Student(string n, int a)
    {
        name = n;
        age = a;
    }
}

Student s1 = new Student("Amit", 20);

Default Constructor - a constructor with no parameters

class student
{
}

Constructor Overloading - multiple constructor with different parameters

class Student 
{
    public Student()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Default Constructor");
    }
    public Student(string name)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello", + name);
    }
}

Real life example :- 
---- when buy a new phone the phone has already a Default language, Default settings. this setup is like a constructor.

in simple words class is a container and objects is thing inside container
