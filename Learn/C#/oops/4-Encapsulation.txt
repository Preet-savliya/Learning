Encapsulation - Encapsulation means hiding data and controlling how it is accessed. in c#, we keep data private and allow access through public methods or properties.

Why Encapsulation is Needed ?

---- Protects data from wrong use
---- Improves security
---- Makes code easy to manage

Example :-

Without Encapsulation

class Student
{
    public int age;
}

// anyone can set

Student s = new Student();
s.age = -10;   // wrong value


With Encapsulation

class Student
{
    private int age;

    public int Age
    {
        get { return age; }
        set 
        {
            if (value > 10)
            age = value;
        }
    }
}

usage

Student s = new Student();
s.Age = 18;
Console.WriteLine(s.Age);

Real-Life Example :-
---- ATM Machine - You cannot touch the cash directly, You use buttons (methods)
