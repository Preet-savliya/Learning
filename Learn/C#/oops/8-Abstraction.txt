Abstraction - Abstraction means hiding complex details and showing only what is necessary. in C# Abstraction is done using abstract classes and interfaces. The abstract keyword is used for classes and methods

📌 Abstraction = Showing only essential features, hiding complexity

Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the derived class (inherited from).

abstract class Vehicle   // abstract class
{
    public abstract void Start();   // abstract method (no body)

    public void Stop()              // regular method
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Vehicle stopped");
    }
}

class Car : Vehicle
{
    public override void Start()   // implementing abstract method
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car started");
    }
}

Usage: 

Car c = new Car();
c.Start();   // Car started
c.Stop();    // Vehicle stopped

2. interfaces 

interface IAnimal
{
    void MakeSound();
}

class Dog : IAnimal
{
    public void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
    }
}

Why Use Abstraction?
---- Hides unnecessary details
---- Only exposes what’s important
---- Makes code easier to use and maintain

Real-Life Examples :-
---- Remote control → you press buttons, don’t see internal wiring
---- ATM machine → you withdraw money, don’t see bank server processes
---- Car → you turn the key, don’t see how engine works
