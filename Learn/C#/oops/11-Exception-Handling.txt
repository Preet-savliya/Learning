Exceptions - Exceptions is like a problem that happens while a program is running. like in real life you are baking a cake, but suddenly you realize there is no sugar. that is an unexpected problem - an Exceptions in your baking process.

Why handle exceptions?
---- So your program doesn’t crash.
---- So you can fix problems or show a friendly message instead of stopping.

Real-life:
---- If you forget sugar, you can buy sugar from a neighbor instead of stopping baking completely.

How C# handles exceptions

try – try doing something

try
{
    int result = 10 / 0;  // This will cause a problem
}

catch – handle the problem

catch (DivideByZeroException)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Cannot divide by zero!");
}

finally – do something anyway

finally
{
    Console.WriteLine("Cleaning the kitchen.");
}


using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        try
        {
            Console.Write("Enter a number to divide 100 by: ");
            int num = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
            int result = 100 / num;  // Might throw an error if num = 0
            Console.WriteLine("Result: " + result);
        }
        catch (DivideByZeroException)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Oops! You cannot divide by zero.");
        }
        catch (FormatException)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Please enter a valid number.");
        }
        finally
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Program finished, thanks for using it!");
        }
    }
}

You try to divide 100 by a number (try).
If you divide by zero, it shows a friendly message (catch).
At the end, it thanks the user no matter what (finally).

✅ Exception handling is like planning for mistakes so your program doesn’t crash and can recover gracefully.
