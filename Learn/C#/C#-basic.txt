1.1 What is C#?

Object-oriented programming language
Used for desktop, web, mobile, cloud, APIs
Runs on .NET Framework / .NET Core

using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
    }
}








1.2 Variables & Data Types

A variable is a named memory location that stores data.
Every variable has a type
Type decides what data it can hold
Prevents runtime errors

Types of Data Types
Value Types

Store actual value directly.

int
double
bool
char
struct

Reference Types

Store memory address (reference).

string
class
array
object

Why this matters in real projects

Value types are faster
Reference types are flexible
Important for performance and memory usage in ERP systems

int age = 20;
double salary = 25000.50;
string name = "John";
bool isActive = true;









1.3 Operators - Operators perform operations on data.
Categories- Arithmetic (+ - * /) , Relational (> < ==),  Logical (&& || !),   Assignment (= += -=)

In real applications

Used for calculations (salary, tax)
Used for conditions (user role, permissions)
Used in validations

int a = 10, b = 5;
int sum = a + b;
bool result = a > b;









1.4 Control statements (Decision Making) - Programs are useless without decision making.

if-else - Used when program must choose based on condition.
Example use cases:

If user is admin → show admin panel
If stock < minimum → alert

if (age>=18)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Adult");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Minor");
}



Loops - Used when work must repeat.

Types:

for → known count
while → unknown count
foreach → collections

ERP relevance

Loop through employees
Loop through transactions
Generate reports


for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}









1.5 Methods - A method is a reusable block of code.
Why methods are important

Avoid repetition
Improve readability
Easy maintenance

In ERP:

CalculateSalary()
GenerateInvoice()
ValidateUser()

static int Add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}



1.6 Arrays & Collections (Handling Multiple Data)

Array -
Fixed size
Same data type

Collections -
Dynamic size
Powerful operations

Common collections:

List -
Dictionary
Queue
Stack

ERP usage -
List of employees
Dictionary of permissions
Queue for background jobs

int[] numbers = {1,2,3};

List<string> names = new List<string>();
names.Add("Alice");
