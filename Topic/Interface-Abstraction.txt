Abstraction - Abstraction is a core principle of object-oriented programming in c# used to hide unnecessary details and show only essential information. 

Declaration: Declared using the abstract keyword.
Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the derived class (inherited from).

abstract class Vehicle   // abstract class
{
    public abstract void Start();   // abstract method (no body)

    public void Stop()              // regular method
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Vehicle stopped");
    }
}

class Car : Vehicle
{
    public override void Start()   // implementing abstract method
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car started");
    }
}


Interfaces - an interface is a pure contract that defines a set of methods, properties, events, and indexers that an implementing class or structured must provide.

Declaration: Declared using the interface keyword and typically named with a leading "I" (e.g; IPaymentProcessor)
Inheritance: a class can implement Multiple interface, providing a flexible way to incorporate behavior from Multiple sources.

public interface IPaymentProcessor
{
    void ProcessPayment(double amount); // Method declaration
}

public class CreditCardProcessor : IPaymentProcessor
{
    public void ProcessPayment(double amount) // Implementation provided by implementing class
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Processing credit card payment of ${amount}");
    }
}
