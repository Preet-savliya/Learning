Sql injections - sql injection is a security vulnerability where an attacker tricks an application into executing unintended sql commands by inserting malicious input into a query. it happens when user input is directly combined with sql code without validation.

why sql injection is dangerous
an attacker may:
---- bypass login authentication
---- view confidential data
---- modify or delete database records 
---- gain full control over the database


Simple concept example 
application builds sql like this

SELECT * FROM Users
WHERE username = 'input' AND password = 'input';

If user input is not handled safely, the database may interpret it as SQL code, not just data.

Root Cause of SQL Injection
---- user input is trusted blindly
---- SQL queries are built using string concatenation
---- No input validation or parameter binding


types of sql injection
1. authentication bypass - logs in without valid credentials
2. data extraction - reads sensitive data
3. data manipulation - updates or delete records
4. blind sql injection - no error shown, attackers infers behavior


SQL Injection is a security attack where malicious input alters SQL queries.
It occurs due to improper input handling and can be prevented using prepared statements, input validation, and least privilege access.
