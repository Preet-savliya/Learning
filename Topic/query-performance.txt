Query Performance - Query Performance refers to how fast a SQL query runs and how efficiently it uses resiurces (CPU, memmory, disk I/O).
fast queries save time and reduce load on the database.

why query performance matters
---- large datasets --> slow queries can freeze applications
---- web and mobile apps require fast response
---- poor performance ---> high CPU, memmory, or disk usage
---- can lead to timeouts or deadlocks

Factors affecting query performance
| Factor           | Explanation                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Indexes          | Queries on indexed columns are faster                |
| Joins            | Large tables joined incorrectly can slow queries     |
| Filters (WHERE)  | Efficient filtering reduces scanned rows             |
| Query Complexity | Subqueries, aggregations, or functions may be slower |
| Data Volume      | More rows → slower without optimization              |
| Network Latency  | Returning huge result sets can take time             |


1. Use Indexes 

CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON Orders(CustomerID);
-- Makes WHERE CustomerID = ? queries faster
-- Avoid indexing columns that rarely appear in searches (wastes space)

2. Avoid SELECT * 
-- only fetch needed columns 

SELECT OrderId, Amount FROM Orders WHERE CustomerID = 101;

-- Reduces I/O and memmory usage

3. use WHERE clauses
-- filter data as early as possible

SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate >= '2025-01-01';

-- prevents scanning the entire table


4. use JOINs efficiently 
-- avoid joining unnecessary tables 
-- ensure join columns are indexed
-- Example: use INNER JOIN instead of cross joins when possible


5. Limit Rows 

SELECT * FROM Orders ORDER BY OrderDate DESC LIMIT 100;

-- fetch only needed rows 
-- reduces memmory and Network traffic

6. Use Query Execution Plan 
-- Use EXPLAIN (MySQL / PostgreSQL) or EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN (SQLite)
-- Check table scans, index usage, join types, and cost

7. Avoid functions in WHERE clauses
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = 2025;

Better:
SELECT * FROM Orders 
WHERE OrderDate >= '2025-01-01' AND OrderDate < '2026-01-01';
