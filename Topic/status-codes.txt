Status Codes - Status Codes are standardized numeric codes used in communication system (most commonly HTTP) to indicate the result of a request. they tell the client whether a request was successful, failed, or requires further action.

In HTTP a status code is a three-digit number returned by a server in response to a client's request, explaining the outcome of that request.

In simple terms, status codes help computers (and developers) understand what happened when a request was made.

Example:
-- 200 --> The request was successful 
-- 404 --> the requested resources was not found
-- 500 --> the server encountered an error

Purpose of status codes:
-- Communicate success or failure of a request
-- Help debug errors
-- Enable proper handling of responses in applications
