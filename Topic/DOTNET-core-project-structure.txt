1. Solution and Project
-- Solution (.sln) - this is a container for one or more projects
-- Project (.csproj) - this contains your code, references, and project-specific settings.

Example:

MyApp.sln
MyApp/
    MyApp.csproj


2. .Net Core project folders & files

MyApp/
|
|- Program.cs
|- Startup.cs            (for ASP.NET core apps)
|- appsettings.json      (configuration)
|- MyApp.csproj          (project file)
|
|
|- Controllers/          (MVC or web API controllers)
|- Models/               (classes representing data)
|- Views/                (Razor views for MVC apps)
|- wwwroot/              (static files like JS, CSS, images)
|- Services/             (business logic classes)
|- Data/                 (EF Core DbContext, migrations)
|_ Properties/
    |_ launchSettings.json (debugging settings)



3. Key file Explanation
| File/Folder                      | Purpose                                                                          |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Program.cs`                     | Entry point of the app. Configures the host and runs the app.                    |
| `Startup.cs`                     | Configures services (dependency injection) and middleware for ASP.NET Core apps. |
| `appsettings.json`               | Stores configuration (connection strings, settings).                             |
| `MyApp.csproj`                   | XML file defining project dependencies, target framework, and build settings.    |
| `Controllers/`                   | Contains controllers that handle HTTP requests.                                  |
| `Models/`                        | Contains data classes or entity models.                                          |
| `Views/`                         | Contains Razor view files (.cshtml) for UI (only in MVC apps).                   |
| `wwwroot/`                       | Web root folder for static files.                                                |
| `Services/`                      | Custom classes handling business logic.                                          |

| `Properties/launchSettings.json` | Configures launch profiles (ports, environment) for debugging.                   |


4. example of a ConsoleApp - a simple console app has a much simpler structure

MyConsoleApp/
|- Program.cs
|- MyConsoleApp.csproj
|- appsettings.json
