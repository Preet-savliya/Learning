Normalization - Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity by spliting data into related tables.

Goals:
1. remove duplicate data
2. prevent update, insert, and delete inconsistency
3. improve data consistency

types of Normalization
1. first normal form (1NF)
---- each field contains atomic values
---- no repeating groups or multi-valued attributes

phone number 123, 456
seperate rows or a related table


2. Second Normal form (2NF)
---- Must be in 1NF
---- no partial dependency on a composite key

orderid + productid ---> productname
move productname to a product table


3. third normal form (3NF)
---- must be in 2NF
---- No transitive dependency

emplyeeid ----> deptid ----> deptname
move deptname to department table








Denormalization - Denormalization is the intentional introduction of redundancy to improve query performance and simplify data access.

1. Improve read performance and simplify queries.
2. Intentionally introduces redundant data by merging tables, reducing the need for joins.
3. Pros: Faster reads, simpler queries.
4. Cons: Higher storage usage, potential for data inconsistency (weaker integrity).
