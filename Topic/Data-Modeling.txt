Data Modeling - Data Modeling is the process of designing how data is structured, stored, and related in a database. it helps ensure data is accurate, consistant, easy to query, scalable as systems grow. think of it as the blueprint for a database.

Core Components 
1. Entities
2. Attributes
3. Primary Keys
4. Relationship
5. Foreign Keys


Types of Data Model
1. Conceptual data Model - high level, abstract view that defines the scope of the system and keys business concepts and rules without technical details. it's used for communication among business stakeholders.

2. Logical Data Model - A detailed representation of the data structures (entities, attributes, and relationships) that can be implemented in a database, but is independent of a specific Database Management System (DBMS).

3. Physical Data Model - The final design that details how data will be physically stored in a specific database, including tables, columns, data types, indexes, and other performance optimization features. 

Key Techniques and Methodologies
1. Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling: A widely used technique that employs diagrams (ERDs) to visually represent entities and their relationships, commonly used for relational database design.

2. Dimensional Modeling: An approach for data warehouses and business intelligence that uses fact tables (measurements) and dimension tables (context) to optimize for analytic queries, often using star or snowflake schemas.

3. Object-Oriented Modeling: Integrates object-oriented programming principles like inheritance and encapsulation into the data model, suitable for complex data relationships.
