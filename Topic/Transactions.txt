Transactions - A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations performed as a single unit of work. transaction follows ACID properties rules

ACID properties
| Property        | Meaning                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| A – Atomicity   | All operations succeed or all fail             |
| C – Consistency | Database moves from one valid state to another |
| I – Isolation   | Transactions don’t interfere with each other   |
| D – Durability  | Once committed, changes are permanent          |


Simple Transaction Example

Imagine transferring $100 from Account A to Account B:

START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Accounts
SET balance = balance - 100
WHERE acc_id = 1;

UPDATE Accounts
SET balance = balance + 100
WHERE acc_id = 2;

COMMIT;
