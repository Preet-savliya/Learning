Views - a view is a virtual table based on a query. it does not store data physically, it retrieves data from one or more tables, and you can query a view just like a table.

Example : Orders by customer view

CREATE VIEW OrdersByCustomer AS
SELECT OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, Amount
FROM Orders;


SELECT * FROM OrdersByCustomer WHERE CustomerID = 101;


Views With Joins - You can create views combining multiple tables

CREATE VIEW CustomerOrders AS
SELECT c.CustomerID, c.Name, o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, o.Amount
FROM Customer c
JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID;


SELECT * FROM CustomerOrders WHERE Name = 'Alice';


Updating Views - Some views are updatable (you can INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

Example of Updatable View
CREATE VIEW ActiveOrders AS
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE Status = 'Pending';

UPDATE ActiveOrders SET Status = 'Shipped' WHERE OrderID = 101;



Dropping a View

DROP VIEW view_name;
