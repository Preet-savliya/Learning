API Naming Conventions
Good naming conventions make your API consistent, readable, and intuitive.

1️⃣ Use Nouns, Not Verbs
-- Endpoints represent resources (entities), not actions.
-- Use HTTP methods to define the action (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Example:
| HTTP Method | URL               | Action                   |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| GET         | `/api/students`   | Get all students         |
| GET         | `/api/students/1` | Get student with ID 1    |
| POST        | `/api/students`   | Create a new student     |
| PUT         | `/api/students/1` | Update student with ID 1 |
| DELETE      | `/api/students/1` | Delete student with ID 1 |

❌ Avoid /api/getStudents or /api/createStudent

2️⃣ Use Plural Nouns for Collections

Plural makes it clear the endpoint returns multiple items.

Correct:
GET /api/students
POST /api/courses

Incorrect:
GET /api/student
POST /api/course


3️⃣ Use Hierarchy for Related Resources
Use nested routes for resources that belong to another resource.

Example: Courses of a student:
GET /api/students/1/courses        // Get all courses of student 1
POST /api/students/1/courses       // Add a course to student 1

4️⃣ Filtering, Sorting, Paging via Query Parameters
Use query strings for filtering, sorting, and pagination instead of creating new endpoints.

Example:
GET /api/students?age=18&sort=name&page=2&pageSize=10

5️⃣ Version Your API
Include the version in the URL to support backward compatibility.

Example:
GET /api/v1/students
GET /api/v2/students

6️⃣ Use Hyphens, Not Underscores
Hyphens improve readability in URLs.

Correct:
GET /api/student-records

Incorrect:
GET /api/student_records

7️⃣ Consistent Naming Rules
----- Lowercase in URLs.
----- Avoid spaces or special characters.
----- Use nouns for resources.
----- Use query parameters for optional filters.
