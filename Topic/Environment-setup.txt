What is Environment Setup in .NET? - Enviornment setup is the process of preparing your system to develop, run, deploy .NET applications by installing the required tools and configuring Enviornments.

1. Install .NET SDK
you must install the .NET SDK for Development

steps:
1. Go to the official .NET website -  https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
2. download the latest .NET SDK (e.g., .NET 10) for your OS: Windows, macOS, Linux
3. Install it and restart your system if needed.

verify installation:
dotnet --version
dotnet --list-sdks


2. Choose an IDE or Code Editor 
you can use any of the following:

| Tool               | Platform              |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Visual Studio      | Windows               |
| Visual Studio Code | Windows, macOS, Linux |
| JetBrains Rider    | Cross-platform        |


For VS Code, Install Extensions:
-- C#
-- .NET Install Tool
-- NuGet Package Manager



3. Set Enviornment variables
Common .NET Enviornment variables:
| Variable                 | Purpose                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` | Defines environment (Development, Staging, Production) |
| `DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT`     | Used in non-web apps                                   |
| `PATH`                   | Includes dotnet CLI                                    |

Example (Windows – PowerShell):
setx ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT "Development"

Example (Linux/macOS):
export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development




4. Create your First Project

dotnet new webapi -n MyFristApi
cd MyFristApi
dotnet run

visit:
https://localhost:5001




5. Configure appsettings Files
create environment Specific configuration:

appsettings.json
appsettings.Development.json
appsettings.Production.json

.NET automatically loads the correct file based on environment




6. Database & Tools 
Depending on your Project:
-- Install SQL server / PostgreSQL / MySQL
-- Install Docker Desktop (for containerized apps)
-- install Git (version control)




Environment setup in .NET is the process of installing and configuring tools, SDKs, and variables required to develop and run .NET applications.
